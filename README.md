## Laravel API Boilerplate (Firebase Edition) for Laravel 11

This is a starter kit you can use to build your first API in seconds. Built on top of Laravel 11 Framework. I developed this for one of my project. This api requires Firebase for authentication, but you can configure to use JWT, Cognito, Sanctum or its up to you. Sharing this as most of the components and framework I used are all open source. 

In building this api, I have the following rest components checklist in mind:

- Firebase Authentication
- Created a basic Endpoint for CRUD
- User Management
- Integrate Rate Limiter base on IP and User using Redis
- Caching Example using Redis
- Apply CSP, CORS and Security Headers
- Versioning using Headers
- Apply Sentry in monitoring Logs
- Apply Gates and Policies to Api
- Apply Repository Design Pattern
- Apply Scrable API Documentation
- Applied Hateoas using https://github.com/willdurand/Hateoas

On Progress with more documentation.
