## Laravel API Boilerplate (Firebase Edition) for Laravel 11

This is a starter kit you can use to build your first API in seconds. Built on top of Laravel 11 Framework.

In building this api, I have the following rest components I have in my checklist:

- Firebase Authentication
- Created a basic Endpoint for CRUD
- User Management
- Integrate Rate Limiter base on IP and User using Redis
- Caching Example using Redis
- Apply CSP, CORS and Security Headers
- Versioning using Headers
- Apply Sentry in monitoring Logs
- Apply Gates and Policies to Api
- Apply Repository Design Pattern
- Apply Scrable API Documentation
- Applied Hateoas using https://github.com/willdurand/Hateoas

On Progress with more documentation.
